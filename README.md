## Responsive Landing Page

### My Task:-
To Create an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when hovering over a menu item.
The navigation menu should have a fixed position and be visible on all pages.
I am supposed to use 
    **HTML** -- To sturcture the menu.
    **CSS**  -- To style it.
    **JS**   -- To add interactivity.
